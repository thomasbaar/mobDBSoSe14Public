This project resembles the Notepad-Tutorial of Google, but has been simplified.
The main changes are:

- Note has been renamed to BNote
- Livefolder-support has been dropped (Livefolder are deprecated and discouraged, anyway)
- TitleEditor - intentfilter category ALTERNATIVE, SELECTED_ALTERNATIVE has been dropped (see manifest)
- unique applications package name is de.htwberlin.selabs.bnote  and is also used to identify item type
- test code underfolder /tests was removed but the eclipse project BNoteTest was added (containing the same code)

Bugs:
- no idea how paste-functionality is supposed to work
- edit-title cannot be invoked any longer



- source comments have largely remained unchained
